# Walmart
This project was an assigned undergraduate capstone project at the culmination of my Bachelor of Science in Business Adiministration program at SNHU. Tasked with using data from Walmartâ€™s in California, Texas, and Wisconsin, I built a model in Python to predict day to day sales of hobby department items in California.
